Finding the open source community has been an eye opening experience. The amount of potential and ingenuity here is amazing and it inspires me to make something fun and useful for anyone to use and learn from.

On my github you can find an automated attendance bot üòù, twitter scraper, and various resources to make your ML life easier.
